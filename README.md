# 🧠 ShippingGPT – Entropy-Aware Operations Framework

**ShippingGPT** is a memory-based, entropy-aware operational intelligence system.  
It tracks, analyzes, and evolves warehouse SOPs based on chaos events, aiming to reduce disorder and increase stability through self-correcting feedback loops.

> "Entropy is not failure—it's signal. We measure it, learn from it, and adapt."

---

## 🚧 What This Is

ShippingGPT is **not just a bot or a program**. It's a modular intelligence framework that includes:

- 📦 Real-time event logging via MongoDB
- 🧾 Adaptive SOP versioning based on live feedback
- 📊 Weekly entropy trend reports
- 🤖 GPT integration for SOP analysis and simulation
- 📁 Human-readable logs, markdown reports, and structured GPT input

## 🧩 Core Modules

| Module              | Purpose                                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `ShippingGPT`        | Executes SOPs, tracks entropy                |
| `ConductorGPT`       | Oversees SOP conflicts + memory tracking     |
| `StrategistGPT`      | Runs entropy simulations + scenario planning |
| `WarehouseGPT`       | Answers warehouse-specific logic + flow      |
| `DeveloperGPT`       | Maintains structural integrity + evolution   |

🎯 GOAL: Complete a Fully Functional, Self-Aware, Real-Time Shipping Intelligence System
That can:

✅ Log chaos

✅ Generate feedback

✅ Propose SOP changes

✅ Version improvements

✅ Talk to GPTs

✅ Serve data via API

✅ Be done

🧠 GAMEPLAN: ShippingGPT — “DONE” Checklist
✅ PHASE 1: Local MongoDB Live
💾 Ground truth memory layer

 Install MongoDB locally (you already did this before—might just need to restart the service)

 Confirm it runs at mongodb://localhost:27017/

 Run test_mongo_connection.py and log_entropy_cli.py to confirm insertions

 Load in a few real test events

Time: 30 min max
I'll give you the exact PowerShell commands if needed.

✅ PHASE 2: API Layer with Flask (Mock or Real Mongo)
🌐 Give GPTs and tools a way to access your system

 Build api/entropy_server.py

 Routes:

GET /entropy/week

GET /stability/current

POST /entropy/log

 If Mongo isn’t ready, mock with fake_db.py

Tested via Postman or curl
Time: 1 hour total

✅ PHASE 3: SOP Chain Integration
🧾 See the loop in action

 Log entropy via CLI

 Generate GPT summary with chatgpt_report_seed.py

 Paste into GPT (ShippingGPT or StrategistGPT)

 Get SOP revision recommendation

 Create sops/[name]_v3.md

 Log in feedback/ and conductor_log.md

Time: 1–2 hours with verification

✅ PHASE 4: Agent Deployment
🧠 Bring the minds online

 Upload each .json + memory bundle to OpenAI GPT builder

 Test prompts: one per agent

 Confirm they reflect core_philosophy.md

Time: 1 hour

✅ PHASE 5: README Final Update + Git Push
🧾 Stamp it.

 Update README.md to reflect fully integrated system

 Push all:

bash
Copy
Edit
