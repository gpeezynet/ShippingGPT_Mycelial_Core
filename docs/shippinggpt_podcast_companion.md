# üéµ ShippingGPT Podcast Companion

## üéß Overview

This file documents the inclusion of the ShippingGPT podcast episode as a supplementary explanation tool. While the thesis stands as the primary framework, this podcast offers a looser, conversational entry point for those exploring the project.

> The podcast isn't the blueprint. It's a walk-through.

## üîß Notes on Current Version

- **Audio quality:** TBD  
- **Narrative clarity:** Partial ‚Äì touches on core loop and motivation, misses deep architecture  
- **Reflects current system build:** Partially

This version was recorded before full stabilization of the SOP-Entropy feedback system. Still useful, but lacks newer vocabulary and loop depth.

## üîé Key Concepts Mentioned

- Entropy as signal, not just disorder
- SOPs as fixed anchors in dynamic systems
- Chaos events as learning triggers
- GPT integration with operational procedures
- Adaptive warehouse logic (feedback > automation)

## üß† Reflection

> "This was the first time we said it out loud. It's not perfect, but it's honest."

The podcast is a reflection of the early voice of ShippingGPT. Good for context, not gospel.

## ‚úÖ Future Actions

- [ ] Add transcript to `docs/transcripts/shippinggpt_intro.txt`
- [ ] Plan refined V2 recording post-stabilization
- [ ] Consider animation or voice overlay for public version
