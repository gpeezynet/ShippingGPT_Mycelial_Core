## ðŸ“Š Entropy Summary

| Event Type            | Count | Root Cause             | Status         |
|-----------------------|-------|------------------------|----------------|
| barcode_scan_failure  | 1     | hardware_failure       | manual_override |
| manifest_mismatch     | 1     | ambiguous_sop          | unresolved      |
| unverified_seal       | 1     | sop_gap                | escalated       |

**Total Chaos Events:** 3  
**Chaos Escalation Rate:** 33%  
**Unresolved Event Rate:** 33%  
**Manual Override Rate:** 33%

## ðŸ§  SOP Gap Analysis

- Scanner redundancy not defined â†’ resolved in v2
- Manifest confirmation was optional â†’ made explicit in v2
- Early sealing lacked containment step â†’ flag & verify added in v2

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Shipping Stability Score (Estimated)

**Formula:** `(Order_Accuracy Ã— On_Time_Rate) / Chaos_Events`

- **Order Accuracy:** 91%  
- **On-Time Rate:** 100%  
- **Chaos Events:** 3  

**Shipping Stability Score:** `~30.33`

_(Baseline established. Goal: increase score by reducing entropy without sacrificing accuracy or speed.)_

---

## ðŸ§¬ System Outcome

- Packing SOP successfully revised to reflect live entropy response.
- First loop closed.
- ConductorGPT confirms **procedural memory is intact** and system is now capable of:
  - SOP versioning
  - Feedback processing
  - Entropy-driven adaptation

---

## ðŸ“Œ Next Actions

- Monitor Packing Station over 7-day window for repeated chaos events
- Create dashboard or markdown tracker for Shipping_Stability over time
- Begin planning Phase 2 entropy loop from `Pick`, `Label`, or `Audit` functions
