# SOP: Packing Station â€“ V1

**Purpose:**  
To ensure outbound packages are labeled and shipped efficiently.

---

## Procedure:

1. Begin by placing packed boxes on the designated staging table.
2. Use Scanner 2 to apply and verify the barcode label for each box.
3. Review the manifest to confirm quantities and contents.
4. Once the box is sealed, move it to the outbound rack.
5. Notify shipping lead when all packages are staged.

---

## Notes:

- Scanner 2 should be available at all times.
- If the scanner isn't working, attempt manual verification.
- No formal process for confirming scanner functionality.
- Sealing should happen immediately after label application, unless otherwise instructed.

---

## Known Issues (Unacknowledged in process):

- No mention of barcode validation timing (pre/post seal).
- No backup scanner protocol.
- No checklist for scanner power or function verification.
- Manifest matching is a manual review without defined step boundaries.
- No log of failed scans or error cases.
