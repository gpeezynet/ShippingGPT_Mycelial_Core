# Standard: Outbound Labeling Accuracy

**Purpose:**  
Ensure that every outbound package is labeled accurately and scannably, matching the manifest before it leaves the packing station.

## Requirements:
1. Each box must be labeled with a scannable barcode.
2. Barcode data must match the shipping manifest item for item.
3. Scanning must be completed before the box is sealed.
4. Barcode scanner functionality must be verified at the start of each shift.
5. Any scanning issues must be logged immediately as an entropy event.

## Justification:
Incorrect labeling leads to order errors, customer dissatisfaction, and additional cost from reshipping. Proper scanning and manifest matching is critical to operational accuracy.
