# SOP: Packing Station – V2

**Purpose:**  
Ensure all outbound packages are labeled with validated barcodes, confirmed against manifest, and sealed only after verification—reducing chaos and increasing traceability.

---

## Procedure

1. **Startup Check**
   - Perform daily scanner function test (power, connectivity, test scan).
   - Ensure backup scanner is available and charged.
   - Log scanner test pass/fail before first pack.

2. **Labeling and Verification**
   - Place packed box on staging table.
   - Scan SKU barcode using Scanner 2.
   - System verifies match against digital manifest.
   - Operator confirms on-screen match and checks digital validation box.

3. **Sealing**
   - Once barcode is validated and match is confirmed, seal the box.
   - If box is sealed early, flag for **post-seal verification** before shipment.
   - Early seals without verification must be logged as entropy events.

4. **Exception Handling**
   - If scanner fails:
     - Switch to backup scanner
     - If both fail, log chaos event immediately
     - Manual labeling is **not permitted** without supervisor override and must be logged
   - Labeling issues must be recorded with timestamp and operator ID

5. **Final Manifest Check**
   - Review packing list vs. manifest before moving box to outbound rack
   - If mismatch is found, rescan and reseal process is initiated
