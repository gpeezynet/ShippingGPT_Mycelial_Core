## Suggested Additions

### ðŸ”§ Equipment Redundancy
- Add requirement to maintain a **backup scanner** at each packing station.
- Require a **daily scanner check** (power, scan test) during shift startup.
- In case of scanner failure, immediately log a chaos event; **do not revert to manual labeling** without supervisor sign-off.

### ðŸ“¦ Sealing Control
- Add **step lockout**: Sealing cannot occur until barcode has been scanned and matched to manifest.
- If seal happens early, box must be flagged for rescan before loading.

### ðŸ“‹ Manifest Validation
- Introduce a **manifest confirmation step**:
  - Scan SKU barcode
  - Visually match to digital manifest screen
  - Confirm with a digital checkbox in packing UI or on physical log sheet

## SOP Structural Impact

- Increases standard compliance: meets Standard #1â€“#4 in `/standards/outbound_labeling.md`
- Reduces root cause exposure to:  
  - `hardware_failure`  
  - `ambiguous_sop`  
  - `sop_gap`

## Recommendation

Approve `packing_station_v2.md` with changes outlined above.  
Track post-deployment entropy events over 7-day window to evaluate effectiveness.
