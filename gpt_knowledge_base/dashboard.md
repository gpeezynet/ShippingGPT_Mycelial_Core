## 🔧 System Health Overview

| Component         | Status       | Notes                                    |
|------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| Packing SOP       | ✅ v2 active | No new chaos reported post-revision      |
| Label Pipeline    | ✅ v1 active | Entropy repeated once – v2 in planning  |
| Picking Station   | ⚠️ Not Deployed | SOP pending – chaos untracked           |
| Daily Reports     | ✅ Week 1–2 | Report loop functional                   |
| Entropy Logging   | ✅ Live      | Tracking 6 events across 2 weeks         |
| API Integration   | ❌ Offline   | OPENAI key missing – mock mode engaged   |
