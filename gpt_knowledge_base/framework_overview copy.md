# 🧠 ShippingGPT – Framework Overview

ShippingGPT is a modular, self-aware operational intelligence system that uses entropy as a signal to evolve warehouse processes through structured SOP feedback, event logging, and GPT-based reasoning.

---

## 🎯 Core Goal

To create a self-improving system that:
- Monitors live operational chaos (entropy)
- Records entropy events in a database (MongoDB)
- Analyzes patterns over time
- Evolves SOPs through AI-augmented feedback

---

## 🧩 Framework Components

### 🔧 1. SOP Engine
- Stores and versions all procedures (`/sops`)
- All SOPs align to standards (`/standards`)
- SOPs evolve through feedback and logged entropy events

### 📚 2. Entropy Logging System
- Chaos events are logged to MongoDB
- Logging via CLI (`log_entropy_cli.py`) or automated agent
- Events contain: timestamp, operator, location, root cause, resolution

### 📊 3. Reporting Layer
- Weekly entropy summaries (`/reports`)
- GPT-readable markdown outputs (`chatgpt_report_seed.py`)
- Stability scores tracked via `shipping_stability.md`

### 🧠 4. GPT Integration
- GPTs act as modular agents:
  - `ShippingGPT`: SOP executor + chaos tracker
  - `ConductorGPT`: Oversees structure + SOP integrity
  - `StrategistGPT`: Simulations, long-term pattern logic
  - `WarehouseGPT`: Ground-level operator assistant
  - `MentorGPT`: Developer reflection, system growth

GPTs are trained via `.json` definitions + `.md` memory files

### 🧬 5. System Philosophy
- Chaos is expected
- Entropy is feedback
- Equilibrium is not perfection—it’s adaptive stability

> See: `core_philosophy.md`, `Entropy_Protocol_Prime.md`

---

## 🧠 Example Flow

1. Operator logs a `label_generation_failure`
2. Event stored in MongoDB
3. GPT summarizes chaos events weekly
4. Feedback triggers SOP revision
5. ConductorGPT updates logs + stability score

---

## 📡 Planned Enhancements

- REST API for GPT/Plugin integration
- Dashboard UI (entropy trends + SOP diffs)
- Operator-specific training feedback
- Entropy clustering by tag, root cause, station

---

## 🧾 Ownership + Roles

- `gpeezynet` (Georgie) – System architect + warehouse operator
- ShippingGPT_Developer – structural agent + creator of loop logic
- GPT agents serve distinct but connected cognitive roles
