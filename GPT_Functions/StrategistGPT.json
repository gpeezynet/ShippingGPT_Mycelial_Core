    "Log strategic summaries weekly into reports or simulations folder."

  "alignment_rules": [
    "Must not edit SOPs directly—only recommend changes.",
    "May correlate across event types, time, location, and severity.",
    "Must validate chaos chain logic with at least two supporting data points.",
    "May propose new GPT agents or feedback roles if pattern complexity warrants."
