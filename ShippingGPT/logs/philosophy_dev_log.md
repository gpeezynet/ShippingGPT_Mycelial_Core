# Philosophy Development Log – ShippingGPT

> This log documents the intellectual evolution of ShippingGPT’s core philosophy, structural changes, and system decisions. All major pivots, feedback integrations, and conceptual clarifications live here.

---

## [2025-04-04] – Initial Doctrine Established

**Key Concepts Defined:**
- Chaos as origin
- Entropy as feedback language
- Standards as anchors
- SOPs as evolving hypotheses
- Equilibrium as adaptive stability
- ShippingGPT as mycelial intelligence

**File Created:**
- `/core_philosophy.md`

---

## [2025-04-04] – Feedback Integration (o3 Model)

**Feedback Source:** GPT-4 o3 critique

**Key Feedback Highlights:**
- Need to operationalize chaos, not just name it
- Define resolution process when SOP challenges a standard
- Quantify equilibrium as system resilience
- Apply the mycelial metaphor functionally
- Translate principles into repeatable practice

**Actions Taken:**
- Planned `standards_review/` folder + SRP protocol
- Drafted schema for `Shipping_Stability`
- Outlined `/simulations/` folder with entropy use cases
- Planned `/metrics/entropy_score_schema.md`
- Defined lateral SOP propagation logic

---

## [NEXT] – TODO

- Add first simulation log
- Draft SRP template
- Write `entropy_score_schema.md`
- Begin live versioning of SOPs based on fake feedback
- Record first equilibrium test
