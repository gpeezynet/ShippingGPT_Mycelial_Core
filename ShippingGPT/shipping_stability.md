## 📊 Definitions

- **Order_Accuracy**:  
  The percentage of total orders fulfilled without error.  
  *(e.g., 99.2% = 0.992)*

- **On_Time_Rate**:  
  The percentage of shipments sent on or before the scheduled time.  
  *(e.g., 96.5% = 0.965)*

- **Chaos_Events**:  
  Count of logged entropy events during the time period.  
  *(e.g., receiving errors, mislabels, short counts)*

- **ε (epsilon)**:  
  A small constant to avoid division by zero and smooth behavior when entropy is low.  
  *Recommended: ε = 1*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This metric is used to measure **systemic stability** under real-time operational conditions.

- A **higher value** indicates high accuracy, timeliness, and low entropy.
- A **lower value** indicates procedural drift, chaos accumulation, or unaddressed entropy.

---

## 📈 Use Cases

- Trigger GPT review or SOP revision when the metric dips below a threshold
- Compare performance by shift, product line, or day
- Serve as the **core KPI** for ShippingGPT’s feedback loop and SOP refinement engine

## 🧪 Example

| Order_Accuracy | On_Time_Rate | Chaos_Events | ε | Shipping_Stability |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|----|---------------------|
| 0.985          | 0.973         | 5             | 1  | 0.958 / 6 ≈ 0.160   |
| 0.991          | 0.990         | 1             | 1  | 0.981 / 2 ≈ 0.490   |

## ✅ Stability Target (suggested thresholds)

- **Above 0.4**: Stable  
- **0.2–0.4**: Monitor  
- **Below 0.2**: Investigate + Review SOPs
