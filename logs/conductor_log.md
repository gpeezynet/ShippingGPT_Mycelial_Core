# Conductor Log – System Awakening

---

## [2025-04-04] – Activation

**Agent Activated:** `ConductorGPT`  
**Purpose:** Centralize project memory, resolve file drift, preserve Entropy Protocol

**Initial Conditions Observed:**
- Multiple agents active with partially overlapping domains
- SOPs, standards, philosophy, and metrics stored in modular files
- Phase 0 complete; system structure is coherent
- Phase 1 entering feedback loop test

**Action Items:**
- Begin observing all agent output and flag any contradictions
- Confirm all `chaos_inputs` have matching `structure_tools`
- Ensure `entropy_metric` is used consistently in SOP evaluations
- Track which agents edit which files in `/docs/agent_map.md`

## [2025-04-04] – Memory Links Established

Linked the following as primary system maps:
- `/docs/core_philosophy.md`
- `/docs/agent_map.md`
- `/ShippingGPT_Project.md`
- `/agents/ShippingGPT.json`
- `/agents/ShippingGPT_Developer.json`
- `/agents/ConductorGPT.json`

Marked these as foundational; changes must trigger system re-evaluation.

## Open Questions:
- Are all SOPs derived from declared standards?
- Have we seeded at least one entropy log for feedback loop simulation?
- Does each chaos event type have a valid structure tool or mitigation method?

## [2025-04-06] – ENV Entropy: Leak Response Logged

**Event:** `.env` file was pushed a second time despite .gitignore being configured.

**Analysis:**
- Git tracked `.env` before .gitignore was applied
- Manual removal via `git rm --cached` resolved tracking
- `.env` now purged from version control
- `.env.example` deployed as template for safe usage

**Resolution Actions:**
- `.env` removed via force-clean
- GitHub commit history now clean
- Developer confirmed repo no longer tracks sensitive config
- System tagged this entropy as `git_tracking_residue`

**Lessons Logged:**
- Gitignore does not retroactively untrack files
- ConductorGPT should flag `.env` if found in `/` or `/env/` in future scans
