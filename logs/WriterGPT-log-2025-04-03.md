### Title: “What No One Told Me About Moving On”

> Grief doesn’t end.  
> It just finds new ways to exist in us.

#### What Grief Feels Like
Some days, I feel okay.  
Other days, the weight of it hits me out of nowhere—like the air is too thick to breathe.

Grief isn’t linear. It doesn’t follow rules.  
It loops, circles, doubles back. Just when you think it’s gone quiet, it speaks again.

#### The Myth of ‘Moving On’
People say you’ll “move on,” like the loss is a chapter you can close.  
But I’ve learned that it doesn’t work that way.

You don’t move on.  
You move *with*.

You carry it. Sometimes openly, sometimes tucked deep.  
But it becomes part of you—not a wound, exactly… more like a scar that hums in the quiet moments.

#### Finding Meaning in Forward Motion
Grief changed me.  
It stripped me down, but it also deepened me.

I’ve found a strange kind of beauty in the fact that I can still laugh.  
That I can still love.  
That I can still show up, even when it hurts.

I don’t try to outrun the grief anymore.  
Instead, I walk beside it.

#### Closing
I’m not the same person I was before the loss.  
But I’m still here. Still becoming. And somehow, that feels like grace.
